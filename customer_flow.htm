<h1>Universal Strategies for Outcome-Driven Services</h1>

<h2>Toolkit Part 2: Customer Flow at Your One-Stop</h2>

<h3>Introduction

<p>High-performing One-Stop Career Centers foster a customer flow that is welcoming, clear, and effective. This includes how the customer is welcomed to the One-Stop, how intake is performed, and how easy they find it to navigate or to be referred to the services they need. This brief will offer some ways for you to improve these processes at your One-Stop.</p>

	<p>So what does effective customer flow mean in practice? It begins with a common service stream that meets as many customer needs as possible. It also allows for appropriate referrals for those customers requiring specialized types of services. When customer flow is universally designed, customers can access all the employment and training services they need. Employers' hiring needs are met. And all these services are explained in language that is clear to all customers.</p>

<p>Good customer flow is key to meeting customers' needs. So how can you tell if your One-Stop measures up? Read the following statements, and see how many apply to your One-Stop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customers are fully aware of the services available to them.</li>

<li>Customers are able to access services based on their individual needs and preferences.</li>

<li>The needs of customers are properly and efficiently identified.</li>

<li>These needs are responded to in an effective and efficient fashion.</li>

<li>Customers are routed to services that will best meet their needs, not in a stereotypical manner. (For example, the One-Stop doesn't just refer all people with disabilities to vocational rehabilitation.)</li>

<li>Services are provided in an integrated fashion, and are not separated into silos or groupings that operate separately.</li>

<li>Services are not duplicated, and resources are used efficiently. </li>

<li>The One-Stop addresses needs that must be met before employment will be successful, such as child care, transportation, and stable housing.</li>

<li>The One-Stop achieves timely job placement for its career seekers.</li>

<li>The One-Stop supports each career seeker to find a position that is reflective of their skills, interests, abilities, preferences, and needs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Challenges</h3>

	<p>Customer flow within One-Stops tend to be based on the typical job seeker and the support they may need in their job search. However, One-Stops serve such a diverse customer base that it is impossible to define the typical experience. On any given day, a One-Stop manager might have a job seeker with a PhD sitting in the resource room next to someone working toward completing their GED. So how can you create a process that serves both those individuals needs in a way that is respectful of their differences and similarities?</p>

<h4>Navigating the One-Stop</h4>
<p>You might feel that your One-Stop is pretty easy to navigate. But what about for customers who have cognitive disabilities, or who can't read posters or signs? Even if staff members are available to answer questions, those customers may feel uncomfortable about asking for help, or even be unsure whether such help exists. All too often, they can feel overwhelmed and may give up on the One-Stop. </p>

<p>One-Stops are frequently crowded, rushed, and noisy. This can be over-stimulating for some customers. Even if they are not physically crowded, some One-Stops have tried to make so much information available to job seekers that all the flyers and announcements on walls and cubes can become overwhelming. </p>

<p>But workplaces are stimulating and chaotic too, right? Well, that's true. But there's a fundamental difference between accessing a career center and possessing the skills necessary for a job. A career seeker who requires a quieter work environment must still be able to navigate their One-Stop. We just can't allow people to become lost in a system that is supposed to help them. </p>

<h4>Diversity of customer base</h4>
	<p>One-Stops have always been called on to serve a wide range of job seekers, but that challenge has increased since 2008. Since the economic downturn, One-Stops are seeing a mix of individuals with experience in manual labor, manufacturing, office work, and high tech.</p> 

	<p>This mix of customers represents a wide range of knowledge and sophistication. Some may be computer programmers, while others have never used a computer. Customer flow processes need to provide support for individuals with limited experience, but not slow down or hinder individuals who can use resources more independently. </p>

<h4>Funding and programmatic silos</h4>
	<p>Your various partners and funding sources all have different requirements and reporting mandates. So it's natural for One-Stop staff to focus on services in silos. This means looking only at their specific service-delivery rules and options, without considering their various partners. However, this approach does not consider the wide range of job seekers' needs. If your focus becomes fitting people into the right slot, rather than creating services that respond to their needs, you'll be wasting energy trying to put a round peg in a square hole. Instead, make it your mission to adapt the customer-service process to fit the widest variety of job seekers. </p>

<h3>Strategies</h3>

	<p>Your goal is to create a One-Stop where most job seekers can benefit from common services, rather than population-specific services. This requires you and your staff to pause and evaluate their processes and how these processes are communicated to customers. There are three strategies that can guide your progress toward effective customer flow:</p>
	<ol type="a">
<li>Intake </li>
<li>Navigation </li>
<li>Referral and Enrollment</li>
</ol>
<h3>Intake </h3>
	<p>Most career seekers at your One-Stop get their first impression of the center at intake. The basic principles of customer service need to be put into practice from the moment someone walks into the One-Stop. One-Stop staff need to ensure that they are responding professionally and are respectful in their interaction with career seekers. In everything they do, staff must communicate that the One-Stop is interested in helping career seekers meet their goal of employment. </p>

	<p>In addition to effective customer service, your intake system should offer systems to distinguish new from returning customers, common intakes, information about services provided in a range of styles, and a single point of contact for each career seeker.</p>

<h4>Welcoming environment </h4>
<p>The first impression that customers have of the One-Stop sets a tone for their expectations and comfort with the services. Even if your One-Stop is in a building that's not especially gorgeous, there's still a lot you can do to make customers feel comfortable and welcome. </p>

<p>Creating a welcoming environment starts even before customers walk in the door. For example, your website tells customers what is available at the center, how the center will be able to meet their needs, and whether this is the right place for them. For individuals who have difficulty traveling to the One-Stop, the web site should help them make an informed decision about the best time to visit and allow them to plan their visit to accomplish as much as possible. At a minimum, the website should include information about:</p>
<ul>

<li>The range of services available </li>

<li>How customers can figure out their eligibility for services</li>

<li>Up-to-date calendars showing orientation sessions, workshops, and employer events</li>

<li>Key personnel to contact for information</li>

<li>Directions (both by car and via public transportation)</li>
</ul>
	
	<p>Your website should follow universal design principles in terms of language, design, ease in finding information, and accessibility. Career Central centers in Florida's Pasco and Hernando counties post their workshops online and have information about each session and any pre-requisites. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.careercentral.jobs/Jobseeker/TrainingEducation/CustWorkshops.aspx">http://www.careercentral.jobs/Jobseeker/TrainingEducation/CustWorkshops.aspx</a></p>


<p>Front-desk staff set the tone for your One-Stop, and their importance can't be overstated. These staff members need training and support so they can clearly answer questions, direct customers to resources, and make all customers feel welcome. </p>

<p>Some customers will only need to be pointed to the correct resource. But others may struggle with understanding spoken and written information, or with communicating their needs. There has to be sufficient coverage at the front desk to allow staff to spend several minutes with each new visitor, as needed. </p>

<p>Washington state's efforts toward a more integrated service systems resulted in greater investment in a highly trained front desk staff. These staff members work exclusively at the front desk, and are focused on customer service results: more accurate information being disseminated, options being discussed, and plans for future contact initiated.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wa.gov/esd/1stop/worksource_initiative/initiative.htm">http://www.wa.gov/esd/1stop/worksource_initiative/initiative.htm</a></p>

<p>You've probably encountered retail stores that include a self-checkout option, along with a human cashier. At your One-Stop, you can also provide options. Would any of these be helpful to your job seekers?</p>

<ul>
<li>Having front desk staff provide initial intake and orientation.</li>

<li>Providing kiosks and/or computer terminals for self-directed initial intake and orientation.</li>

<li>Using video or PowerPoint on kiosks/computer terminals, or on a monitor in the waiting area, to provide a guide to initial intake/orientation.</li>

<li>Providing initial intake/orientation information on your website.</li>
</ul>

<p>For individuals who do not speak English, it is still possible to welcome individuals and provide some basic answers through the use of Google Translate (http://translate.google.com on the web; also available via smartphone app.) Once they have identified the language used by the individual, the staff person can type in a welcome message and the Google site can provide audio output in the requested language. The job seeker can type their question in and have it translated back into English within seconds. This type of tool is helpful for basic communication. However, for more in-depth assessment and case management, a translator should be used. </p>

<h4>Signage </h4>
	<p>Clear signage is very important in helping people navigate a One-Stop. Individuals who are more self-directed will not need to stop and ask questions, which saves staff time as well as making it more efficient for the job seeker to get to what they need. The balance of simple signage with the amount of materials that need posting can be difficult. In an effort to inform, some centers post so much information that job seekers become confused and cannot determine what information is essential. </p>

	<p>Signs that direct people to key elements of the center, such as registration and the resource room, should be the same size and style so that people quickly see these signs as navigational. When possible, icons or diagrams should be on signs as well for individuals who have difficulty reading. </p>

	<p>Hempstead Works in Long Island NY has information in various formats: not just English and Spanish, but in Braille, audio, and with the use of pictures and images. Forms and signage do not use technical jargon or acronyms, but refer to services in a common language that any customer can understand.</p>

	<p>In thinking about signage, the most effective way to develop a plan is to have staff enter the Career Center and consider it from the perspective of a new customer. Then answer the following questions:</p>
	<ul>
<li>Is it immediately clear where to go if you have never been to the center before? </li>

<li>Is information about the center's services well organized, visually appealing, and easy to use? Is similar information, such as hot jobs or training opportunities, grouped in the same area?</li>

<li>As people move further into the center, do they know what space is public and what areas are restricted to staff only? Is that information clear but not off-putting in how it is presented?</li>

<li>Are training rooms clearly named and marked? </li>

<li>Within the resource room, are materials clearly named, sorted, and labeled? </li>

	<li>Use of mystery shoppers and similar strategies can also be helpful in identifying signage needs.</li>
	</ul>

<h4>Distinguishing new from returning customers</h4>
	<p>Customers who are visiting the One-Stop for the first time are likely to need more information and guidance than those who are returning. The JobSource in Southern Maryland took the simple but effective step of adding a check box on their sign-in sheet to identify first-time visitors to their center. Customers who identify themselves as first-time visitors are given a brief but comprehensive welcome to the center by front-desk staff, and are informed about the variety of options available to them at the center.</p>

<h4>Common intake</h4>
<p>Common intake is a feature of many One-Stop systems. This means that individuals only need to sign up once in order to be registered with all partners within the One-Stop. This helps avoid the wasted time and redundancy of multiple intakes being performed for the same person. It also helps ensure that the intake process is used to identify and respond to the diversity of customer needs, and includes a broad range of programs. The Texas Workforce Commissions TWIST system is an example of such an approach. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.twc.state.tx.us/svcs/twist/twisthp.html">http://www.twc.state.tx.us/svcs/twist/twisthp.html</a></p>

<h4>Information about services provided in a range of styles</h4>
<p>Different customers process information in different ways. So your One-Stop should provide a variety of means by which customers can learn about the various services available to them -- on their first visit, and every time they return to the center. </p>

<p>The service flow documentation of the Northern Panhandle WIB, in Wheeling, West Virginia, illustrates how the center approached this goal. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.npworkforcewv.org/assets/NPWIB%20pdf/Scope%20of%20Services%20Plan.pdf">http://www.npworkforcewv.org/assets/NPWIB%20pdf/Scope%20of%20Services%20Plan.pdf</a></p>

<h4>Single point of contact</h4>
<p>Having a single point of contact, both for job seekers and employers, can increase consistency and responsiveness to customer needs. It can also ensure that information and services are provided in a way that is respectful of individual preferences, and that services are delivered within the universal design context. Again, the Northern Panhandle WIB in Wheeling, West Virginia has crafted a useful policy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.npworkforcewv.org/assets/NPWIB%20pdf/Scope%20of%20Services%20Plan.pdf">http://www.npworkforcewv.org/assets/NPWIB%20pdf/Scope%20of%20Services%20Plan.pdf</a></p>

<h3>Navigation</h3>

	<p>The easier it is for career seekers to navigate your One-Stop, the more time your staff will have for service provision. Clean and efficient customer flow processes are likely to improve independent navigation for career seekers as well as business customers. </p>

<h4>Development of integrated customer flow process</h4>
<p>First, you'll need to undertake a careful analysis of services provided by your One-Stop's various partners, and determine how to combine these into an overall customer flow. Such a process requires input from the full range of One-Stop partners, as well as a cross-section of your customers. It also requires spending the necessary time to comprehensively understand how customers interact with the system at each step of the process. </p>

<p>The Customer Flow Toolkit, created by the New York Association of Training and Employment Professionals and the New York State Department of Labor Customer Flow Work Team, provides a comprehensive approach to analysis and development of customer flow, with an emphasis on integrated services. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.eric.ed.gov:80/PDFS/ED462554.pdf">http://www.eric.ed.gov:80/PDFS/ED462554.pdf</a></p>

	<p>This toolkit provides the basis for an improved customer flow process, but that's only half the battle. You'll also need to focus on whether the flow is inclusive of all career seekers. 
Ensure that at each step in the process, consideration has been given to the potential diversity of customer needs, and that the information and services provided will be fully responsive to those needs. Does your Core Services area have support for individuals who may be new to the use of computers, or who need accommodations to use them efficiently?</p>


<p>Provide a range of options for services that respect different preferences in terms of learning style, culture, etc. For example, some customers will want privacy and space to understand an issue, while others will actively seek the support of a staff person.</p>

<p>Ensure that both customers and staff are aware of additional assistance that is available to customers. In an environment with as many different resources as your One-Stop, even staff can lose track of everything that's available to their customers.</p>

	<p>To make this planning process as effective as possible, and to ensure that the end result truly speaks to the needs of customers, a diverse range of career-seekers and businesses should be involved in the planning process. Also, customer satisfaction data should be collected and used as a central part of this process.</p>

<h4>Process mapping</h4>
<p>Process maps can be helpful visual aids for both leadership and staff as you attempt to understand and refine your center's customer flow process. One example is the Western Virginia Workforce Development Board: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.westernvaworkforce.com/library/documents/Center_planning/flow_chart%20_Individuals.pdf">http://www.westernvaworkforce.com/library/documents/Center_planning/flow_chart%20_Individuals.pdf</a></p>

<h4>Lean principles to analyze customer flow</h4>
		<p>Using Lean principles can lead to processes that are highly efficient and responsive to customer's needs. These principles include the following:</p>
		<ul>
<li>Focus on the customer, their expectations, and what they perceive as value.</li>

<li>Cultivate a passion for continuous improvement in the elimination of waste.</li>

<li>Identify where an organization adds value and the identification of non-valuable activities.</li>

<li>Create the ability for activities to flow through a process map in the shortest amount of time possible.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The Southwest Washington Workforce Development Council has used Lean principles to develop integrated service flows for both job seekers and businesses. <a href="http://www.wa.gov/esd/1stop/docs/framework_initiative/Integration_Framework-VSM_June_2010.pdf">http://www.wa.gov/esd/1stop/docs/framework_initiative/Integration_Framework-VSM_June_2010.pdf</a></p>


<h4>Multiple mechanisms to help customers navigate</h4>
	<p>Once you've created a unified customer flow process, you'll need to figure out several ways to make it clear to customers. Three mechanisms are customer flow charts, menus of services, and use of video. These can be used in combination to ensure that all customers fully understand the services available.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Customer Flow Chart
	<p>A flow chart is a graphic representation of how to access and navigate services. There are two basic keys for One-Stop customer flowcharts under universal design:</p>
<p>The flowchart should be a common one for all job seekers, rather than separate flow charts for different customer groups and services.</p>

<p>The flowchart should use simple and clear language, colors that easily identify different service elements, and symbols with clear explanations. Any other graphics incorporated within the flow chart must also help ensure clear understanding of the One-Stop service flow.</p>
</li>
	<li>Menu of Services
	<p>A menu of services clearly and concisely explains the services available at the One-Stop. This can be of great value to a customer who is new to the center, or seeking to access further services. The menu should clearly explain to One-Stop customers the services available and how to access them. </p>

	<p>This should be a common menu for all job seeker customers, rather than different menus for different groups and populations. At the same time, it must be clear about how customers can get extra assistance. One good example is the MontgomeryWorks User's Guide: <a href="http://www.montgomeryworks.com/brochures.asp">http://www.montgomeryworks.com/brochures.asp</a></p>
</li>
<li>Video Service Menu
<p>Using video to explain the flow of services can be useful for visual learners and for people with limited written literacy. Note that this is not a promotional video for your One Stop. It should provide an actual tour of services and clearly explaining how to access them. Make sure the video is open-captioned, and incorporate graphics to illustrate information. </p>

<p>The video should use clear and simple language and be jargon-free. It should also reflect the diversity of customers. While the video may feature specialized services for particular groups, it should also show a diversity of individuals using general One-Stop services  e.g., a person in a wheelchair participating in a workshop that is not specifically for people with disabilities. </p>

<p>You can distribute the video through multiple channels: on the One-Stop website, in the waiting area on a continuous loop, in the resource library where individuals can listen using headphones, and on YouTube. Easy access to video is important for individuals who may need to view information several times for full understanding and reinforcement. Easy access also allows individuals with anxieties or concerns about using the One-Stop to become familiar with the services available and mechanisms for accessing them, prior to coming to the One-Stop. </p>

<h3>Referral and Enrollment</h3>

<h4>Staff comfort level </h4>
<p>For your staff to feel comfortable with a variety of job seekers, they'll need to routinely work with many different people. Through this exposure, they will come to understand that job seekers are really more alike than different, whatever their backgrounds and challenges.</p>

<p>Training for front-line staff is critical to ensure that they are responsive to customers. Focus on the following:
Offering good customer service and creating a welcoming environment.</p>

Respecting the diversity of customers' needs and preferences.

Avoiding an ethnocentric view (i.e., viewing customers from the perspective of your own life). Staff must recognize that customers have a variety of life experiences that influence their perceptions, views, and behavior.

The basics of different learning styles and how to respond to different learning preferences.

Understanding various cultural perspectives, including those of the various ethnic, racial, and linguistic cultures represented in the local service area, as well as the cultures of poverty and long-term unemployment.

Taking initiative to respond to customer needs. This includes providing accommodations to customers with disabilities and communicating with non-native English speakers. 

Training should cover the best ways to address common challenges, such as gaps in work history, rather than the cause of the gap. Remember that, no matter how good your training is, it's through working with many people that staff attitudes and comfort levels can be improved. 

While gaining this experience, staff many benefit from being mentored by a more senior staff person other than their supervisor. They should feel free to share their concerns or frustrations with this mentor, without fear of reprisal. This supportive and open relationship can help staff identify and address attitudes or skill gaps that may have prevented them from being effective with certain job seekers. 

Creating cross-agency referral guides for staff and customers
	Your One-Stop has a wide variety of partners, each with distinct eligibility and referral policies and practices. Your staff may often struggle as much as your customers to remain knowledgeable of these systems. To create a common base of staff knowledge across systems, the DC Works! One-Stop Career Centers in Washington, DC created a set of program and referral guides for all majors partners around the following outline:

1.	Name of Agency, Program or Project
2.	Internal (co-located) or External
3.	Services Offered
4.	Basic Eligibility Requirements
5.	Referral Process
6.	TimeLine
7.	Primary Contact
8.	Performance Measures (for Staff Use Only)

	The resulting guides provided staff the information they needed to make accurate and appropriate referrals for customers to partner systems, and to provide customers with a clear expectation of eligibility rules, service offerings, and timeline for service provision.

	Referral should result in customers having access to a broader range of services and supports. However, in many cases, staff refer customers away from one service when referring them to another. 

	To overcome this tendency, and to ensure that their customers have the widest possible range of services and support, staff in the DC Works! One-Stops collaborate across agency lines to provide multiple services to their customers. Even in cases where a customer must delay a job search temporarily to access another service (e.g., to attain a GED, or to receive skill-specific training), career counselors maintain contact with them through regular check-in phone calls. One-Stop staff also keep an open line of communication with the training partner to ensure the customer is successful. 

Conclusion

	It's essential that all your customers feel welcomed and respected at your One-Stop. Information on the array of services available to them should be presented clearly and concisely in multiple media, and at multiple points in the customer service process. Taking the time to ensure improved customer flow will pay off by freeing up staff time and by improving the customer experience.

Steps You Can Take

Create a task force of staff from multiple agencies, business customers, and career seekers to document and analyze your One-Stop's current customer flow. This working group should be empowered to make improvements to the current system, and should have the support of managers to take the time required to create and implement these changes. 

Develop a variety of mechanisms for communicating the service flow to customers. These mechanisms must use and show respect for the full array of potential customer needs and preferences in terms of information and learning style.

Gather customer satisfaction data at various points in their career development process, and ensure that this information is used to make improvements.
Train all One-Stop and partner staff on the essential processes of customer service, customer flow, and referral.

Ensure that leadership and management set the tone and the expectation of a customer-driven, professional One-Stop environment, based on respect for both staff and customers.
