<h1>Universal Strategies for Outcome-Driven Services</h1>

<p>The workforce system is designed to serve every career seeker in a community, regardless of barriers (or perceived barriers) to employment, and assist them in achieving employment success. One-Stops also serve businesses of varying sizes and industries that require a broad range of talent to meet their workforce needs. The workforce system serves a diverse range of customers, including individuals with a variety of educational and work backgrounds; people from diverse racial, linguistic, and ethnic cultures; and individuals with a wide range of disabilities and support needs. </p>

<p>One-Stops cannot reasonably develop specifically tailored solutions for each of the many customer groups they serve. To function as an outcome-oriented, effective, and efficient operation, the One-Stops must provide supports and services that appropriately respond to a diverse customer base. Specialized services may be required for some individuals, but for the majority of customers Universal Strategies for Outcome-Driven Services provides a proactive approach to meeting most customers needs. </p>

<p>To find a manageable approach to meeting the needs of their many customers, One-Stop Career Centers can think broadly and inclusively about how they design their physical space, service delivery systems, and customer resources.  This toolkit highlights key elements of the workforce services in the following areas: </p>

<ol type="I">
<li><strong>Marketing and Outreach </strong>
<p>An inclusive center begins with a communications strategy reaching the broadest array of businesses and career seekers in the community.  Externally, this means making sure that your staff and leadership are visible in the community, and working closely with the groups, agencies and organizations that represent various community members.  Internally, it is essential to ensure a professional, respectful environment within the center that will generate positive word of mouth, particularly in tightly bound communities where word travels fast about good  or bad  services.</p></li>

<li><strong>Customer Flow </strong>
<p>How customers make their way through the One Stop and its partner entities is crucial to a Centers success.  Is Center navigation clear and intuitive, or cluttered, bureaucratic and intimidating?  Are the customers options understandable to them, and is it clear how they can access these options?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><strong>Intake and Welcoming </strong>
<p>The front desk of the One Stop is a vital point in the customer service process.  Well-trained, courteous and knowledgeable staff set a tone of welcome and professionalism for career seekers and businesses visiting the center.  Front desk staff who understand the range of services available can create realistic expectations for the customer, and point them toward the staff and services who can best meet their needs, reducing both customer frustration, and staff time required to re-direct customers. </p>
</li>

<li><strong>Navigation </strong>
<p>Signage, environment and staff professionalism all contribute to the ease with which a One Stop can be navigated.  On the simplest level, is there signage for various customer-accessible areas?  Is that signage written in terminology that anyone would understand, or does it use the technical designation for various programs?  The more welcoming and accessible a center is, the less time staff will need to spend directing their customers through it.</p></li>

<li><strong>Referral and Enrollment</strong>
<p>Referrals to various partners within One-Stops is how many services are provided, yet it can be an area where customers feel disconnected or shuttled across bureaucracies. What is the process by which customers are referred to and enrolled in new services? Are staff aware of the basic eligibility rules and intake procedures for partners programs, and are appropriately addressing customer expectations as they make referrals?  Customers should be able to take advantage of all the services that would be of value to them, and for which they are eligible. Likewise, customers should not be automatically referred to partners based on one demographics variable (all customers with disabilities automatically referred to vocational rehabilitation) without considering the range of appropriate resources. </p></li>
</ol></li>

<li><strong>Assessment </strong>
<p>Assessment tools can be valuable sources of information on a customers needs, goals and skills.  What they should not be is a means to screen customers out of services and opportunities.  Staff should be versed in a variety of assessment tools that properly gauge the needs and strengths of their customers, lead to better referrals and help set a career direction and ultimate placement.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Service Delivery </strong>
<p>Since One-Stops provide a variety of services and have a  wide range of job seekers needing those services, Career Centers must think broadly about how to use their resources to most effectively support their business and career seeking customers.  Both Core and Intensive or partner-based services depend on their capacity to be effective for a wide array of customers. </p>
<ol type="a">
<li><strong>Core: Resource Area</strong>
<p>The general areas of the One Stop, including the computer lab and other frequently utilized areas, must be well designed to be effective.  As they typically have limited staff available,  it is important that customers feel comfortable and self sufficient, and that all staff be attentive to the needs of career seekers in these areas.  Noticing when a customer seems confused and offering assistance can prevent that customer from becoming frustrated, and potentially exiting the center. Computers have a variety of pre-installed accessibility features that can make them easier to use for a variety of job seekers (i.e. increasing font size of a web page could make it easier for an older worker to read the information). ensuring that computers can be used independently will help free up staff for other duties.  </p></li>

<li><strong>Core: Orientation/Workshops</strong> 
<p>Workshops are also group settings, and facilitators and trainers cannot make assumptions about their participants, their learning styles, or the information that could most benefit them.  Workshops must appeal to all learners, and information about various programs  even those specifically designed for veterans, or people with disabilities, or individual transitioning out of incarceration  must be made available to all customers.  It is only by broadcasting this information to all customers that the customer with hidden barriers can be informed of their options. Adult learning theory should be applied in workshops so that participants have a clear sense of whats in it for me. </p></li>

<li><strong>Intensive/Case Management</strong>
<p>The case manager/customer relationship is often the career-seekers primary personal link to their job and career search.  Case managers must be mindful of this, both in terms of building the trust of their customers, as well as fostering their customers self-sufficiency. Staff needs to understand how cultural differences impact a career-seekers view of the career-development process, and provide support and encouragement through the prism of these differences.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><strong>Business Service </strong>
<p>The business customer is equal in importance to the career seeker.  Staff must be knowledgeable of and active in the employer community, and come to be identified as a trusted resource.  One-Stops must outreach to businesses of all sizes, industries and types to open the doors of opportunity to the diverse range of their career-seeker customers.   Candidate referrals must be made with knowledge of the technical skills needed by a successful candidate, as well as a clear sense of the culture of the workplace and that individuals fit within it. </p>
</li></ol>
